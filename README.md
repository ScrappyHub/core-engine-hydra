# CORE ENGINE — HYDRA (Water & Fluid Resonance)

HYDRA models fluid flow + resonance:
- Navier-Stokes domains
- pressure waves + standing pressure nodes
- cavitation potential, vortex structures
- coupling inputs from acoustic/thermal/EM

## Non-negotiables
Deterministic. Headless. Hash-verified artifacts. No auth.

## Authority
Inherits CORE Platform governance. Physics-only repo.
