# HYDRA — Fluid & Water Resonance Engine

HYDRA is a deterministic fluid-domain physics engine.

It computes **fluid behavior and resonance**, not operational control.

---

## Engine Role

**Engine Type:** TRUTH_ENGINE  
**Domain:** Fluid dynamics & water resonance  
**Execution Context:** CORE-orchestrated only

---

## What HYDRA Computes

- velocity and pressure fields
- laminar vs turbulent regimes (as declared)
- vortex structures
- pressure waves in fluids
- cavitation potential indicators

---

## Prohibitions

HYDRA does NOT:
- control pumps or valves
- issue operational recommendations
- infer intent or causality
- access networks
- publish independently

---

## Determinism & Outputs

HYDRA outputs sealed, reproducible fluid-domain artifacts verified by CORE.

---

## Governance

HYDRA is permanently bound by CORE governance and registry law.
